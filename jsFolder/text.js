Step 1: print on the console
console.log("Let's build a pyramid using JavaScript basics:");
console.log("    #    ");
console.log("   ###   ");
console.log("  #####  ");
console.log(" ####### ");
console.log("#########");

Step 2: declare a variable
let character;

Step 3: pass value to the "character" variable
let character = "Hello";

Step 4: single quotes
let character = 'Hello';

Step 5: print the value of the variable on console
let character = "Hello";
console.log(character);

Step 6: change the value of the character
let character = "Hello";
character = "World";
console.log(character);

Step 7: print both values
let character = "Hello";
console.log(character);
character = "World";
console.log(character);

Step 8: write variable using camelCase technique
let secondCharacter;

Step 9: due to no value in the variable this will show undefined
let secondCharacter;
console.log(secondCharacter);

Step 10: Assign "Test" value to the secondCharacter
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = "Test";
console.log(secondCharacter);
